DESCRIPTION

This application is a fun quiz app that allows users to test their knowledge through various quizzes.
Quiz-app application implemented in react.js language. Additional libraries used are: MUI, axios, API for Trivia games.
This README document provides essential information about the app, how to install and use it, as well as some of the
special features and challenges we faced during development.

PROCCES

The development process was not so smooth, things related to the development of the react.js application were the
easiest part, but the implementation of the logic itself was a more complex problem.

- In this application, we have the following functionalities implemented in order:

- Entering the username and then selecting the game settings in which the use of axios and API is included

- The main game, which represents the choice of four offered answers and the choice of jumping to the next 
question and the forced ending of the game

- And after the end of the game, a page was implemented with the display of all the answered questions and
other data needed to display the results of the game


In the application we have the following mini functionalities:
timer (the limited time for answering the questions is 2 min, after it expires, you go to the page for
displaying the results)
